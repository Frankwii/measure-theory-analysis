Some notes on Measure Theory, with some applications on Real Analysis and
Probability Theory. Started as a Final Degree Project for my Bachelor's
Degree, currently expanding on it.

Mostly following Robert Ash's Real Analysis and Probability.

WORK IN PROGRESS: 
 * Expanding the section on Measure and Topology.
 * Migrate from UIB template.
